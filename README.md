# **Come Forth The Dragon!**

*Game based on a C++ Forth Interpreter.*

## Description
The player adventures on a quest into a castle. The castle is filled with numerous enemies (such as goblins, dragons, and other beasts). There will be puzzles. Each room has the player face a time-sensitive situation that requires stack operations. For example, the beast demands “Double the top value of the stack, or I will steal your soul!”(the player will be told how long they have, maybe 5 seconds). Similarly, a goblin may go, “Push the number 8 onto the stack before I steal away 10 pts!”. Other challenges may be environmental choices the player makes, such as “The bridge is collapsing. You have 10 seconds to swap 5 and 7 on the stack before you fall”. Successful completion of the challenge allows the player to progress to the next level, and failure either takes away points or lives. 

The game will have UI (as far as planned) such as different themes like a dungeon, throne, tower, etc. Levels will become harder, and the end will be a boss that requires a sequence of actions to take place in order for the player to succeed. Each game should feel different or unique. Players will start with a set amount of pts or lives and may earn more (or not, if we want it to be a competitive/run-through-styled game)  through challenges.


### Project Overview

Our team will develop a Forth Interpreter in C++ that ‘gamifies’ the system; the game, titled “Come Forth The Dragon”, will have players embark on a quest filled with enemies, challenges, and puzzles that will require skill in forth, stack knowledge, and quick-thinking efforts. 
Objectives

Our objectives are to dive further in our understanding of Forth, utilizing it with gameplay mechanics that will allow players to have a fun and interactive experience while similarly learning about forth and the stack through gameplay and trial and error. It will furthermore be shown that programming can be enjoyable while being educational at the same time. Furthermore, it will showcase the team’s collaboration skills, coding, and communication. 

The game will be based on the Forth system, keeping its elements but building upon it to induce gameplay mechanics. Players will use forth commands and analysis of the stack to progress their gameplay. 

### Feature Focus:

Integrating forth in a novel application of a castle-based game
Implementing time, creative functions, and engaging mechanics
Making proper UI/UX 
Having good collaboration and teamwork
