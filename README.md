### Work In Progress
Game-type development of a C++ Forth Interpreter, exact idea not yet discussed

### Project Overview
Our team will develop a Forth Interpreter in C++ that 'gamifies' the system; potentially being a game or interactive creative application.

### Objectives
Our objectives are to dive in further to understanding and interacting with Forth, integrating other creative elements in the system to deliver a fun and interactive experience so that it can be shown that programming can be enjoyable while being educational at the same time. Furthermore, it will showcase the team's collaboration skills, coding, and communication.

### How it will extend our collective efforts with FORTH
The game will be based on the Forth system, keeping its elements but building upon it to induce gameplay mechanics or further scripts for a creative outcome.

## Feature Focus
- Integrating forth in a novel application
- Creating new functions and engaging mechanics
- Making proper UI/UX
